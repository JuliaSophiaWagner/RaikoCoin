# Raiko – Official Whitepaper (Meme Edition)
*“The only coin that barks back.”*

## Introduction

**Raiko (RKO)** is a meme-driven, community-powered storytelling project launched on the **Pepu Unchained** blockchain. It merges lore, memes, and NFTs into a shared digital universe called the **Raikoverse**.

> No investment promises. No pump. Just chaos, fun, and tail-wagging creativity.


## 🔗 Token Details

- **Blockchain:** Pepu Unchained (L2 on Ethereum)  
- **Token Name:** Raiko  
- **Symbol:** RKO  
- **Launched via:** PumpPad  
- **Contract Address:** *To be announced post-launch*  

**Note:** No presale. No airdrops. No staking. Just a token to represent the journey.


## 🧠 Purpose

- Build a meme-fueled storytelling universe (Raikoverse)  
- Let the community decide Raiko’s fate through weekly votes  
- Publish short lore-based stories 
- Optionally mint NFTs tied to the community-created content


## 📚 How the Lore Works

1. Each week, the community votes via Telegram on Raiko’s next move.  
2. The winning option becomes a new short story (PDF/HTML).  
3. Stories are published on social media and optionally minted as NFTs later.
